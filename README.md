# Mask Detection Using YOLOv5
## Problem Statementüìù
COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the world trade and movements. Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Therefore, face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society.
COVID-19 mask detector could potentially be used to help ensure your safety and the safety of others
